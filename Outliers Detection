> About the dataset: <

In industrial settings, diagnosis involves identifying abnormal functioning in sensor data, 
which can result from various factors such as equipment failure, control system malfunctions, or environmental changes. 
Detecting anomalies is crucial for making informed decisions and taking corrective actions. 
With the advent of IoT systems, industrial data generation has increased significantly, posing challenges in analyzing complex systems. 
Machine learning tools offer a logical approach to address these diagnostic challenges by leveraging large volumes of data. 
This dataset aims to explore the application of machine learning techniques for fault detection and diagnosis in industrial systems.

> About the features of the sensor:<

Time series of measurements on sensors uniquely identified by a Sensor ID.
During the series of measurements, the sensor is disconnected or on failure.
SensorID = 1 = PT100 temperature sensor, in an industrial environment, with dust & vibrations

Timestamp -- Time
SensorId -- Unique Id of the sensor
Value -- Value mesaured on the sensor at timestamp
